<h3 style="color:#151515"><center><font face="Trebuchet MS">In high school, my physics class decided to have a cookie exchange and I was stuck.  I couldn't decide what cookies to make. After consulting with my brother and his girlfriend (the famly bakers) I was sent this recipe. I made two batches of these white chocolate cranberry cookies and brought them to school the next day. They were gone in minutes.</font></center></h3>

<h2 style="color:#191970">Ingredients</font></h2>

<p><input type="checkbox">3/4 cup (12 Tbsp; 170g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature <br>
<input type="checkbox">3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar (I use dark)<br>
<input type="checkbox">1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar <br>
<input type="checkbox">1 large egg, at room temperature <br>
<input type="checkbox">2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract <br>
<input type="checkbox">2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)<br>
<input type="checkbox">2 teaspoons cornstarch (cornflour) <br>
<input type="checkbox">1 teaspoon baking soda <br>
<input type="checkbox">1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
<input type="checkbox">3/4 cup (135g) white chocolate chips, plus a few extra for garnish <br>
<input type="checkbox">1 cup (140g) dried cranberries, plus a few extra for garnish</p></font>

<h2 style="color:#191970">Directions</h1>
<p><ol type="1">
<li>In a large bowl beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together until combined and creamy. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. </li>
<li>In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt together. Slowly mix into the wet ingredients until combined. The cookie dough will be soft and thick. Add the white chocolate chips and dried cranberries and beat on low speed until combined. Cover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</li>
<center>**Chilling is imperative to prevent the cookies from over-spreading.**</center>
<li>Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator, if needed let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This makes the firm cookie dough easier to scoop and roll.</li>

<li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside. </li>
<li>As the oven preheats, scoop and roll dough, about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough each, into balls. The dough may be slightly crumbly, but will come together as you work it with your hands. Arrange dough balls 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
<li>Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. The centers will still look soft. </li>
<li>Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. During this time, press extra white chocolate chips and dried cranberries into the warm tops. This is optional and only for looks. After 5 minutes, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
